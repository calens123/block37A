COUPLE OF NOTES:
1. Apologies for the issues with formatting in the API documentation at the bottom of this README, I've been trying to get it to show up perfectly but this is about as good as I can get it.
2. I was able to get through everything and complete all my testing up to doing PUT and DELETE on reviews belonging to specific users. I changed my reviews.js and server.js files dozens of times trying to get the Postman tests to work, with no luck. So eager to hear about how I can update those. 

**Project Plan: RESTful API with Many-to-Many Relationships**

### **Goal**
Build a RESTful API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete items, reviews, and comments. The API should also include user authentication, relationships between resources, and proper documentation.

---

### **Milestones**

#### **Milestone 1: Setup and Initialization**
1. Create a GitHub repository for version control.
2. Initialize the project with `npm init -y`.
3. Install necessary dependencies.
   - Production: `express`, `prisma`, `@prisma/client`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, `morgan`, `dotenv`
   - Development: `nodemon`, `jest`, `supertest`
4. Initialize Prisma with `npx prisma init`.
5. Create a `.env` file to store environment variables like `DATABASE_URL`.

---

#### **Milestone 2: Database Design**
1. Define the models in `schema.prisma`.
   - **User**:
     - `id`, `username`, `email`, `passwordHash`
   - **Item**:
     - `id`, `name`, `description`, `averageScore`
   - **Review**:
     - `id`, `text`, `score`, `itemId`, `userId`
   - **Comment**:
     - `id`, `text`, `reviewId`, `userId`
2. Establish relationships:
   - Users have many reviews and comments.
   - Items have many reviews.
   - Reviews have many comments.
3. Push the schema to the database with `npx prisma db push`.

---

#### **Milestone 3: Authentication and Middleware**
1. Create user authentication routes:
   - `POST /api/auth/register`: User registration.
   - `POST /api/auth/login`: User login.
   - `GET /api/auth/me`: Fetch logged-in user details.
2. Use `bcrypt` for password hashing and `jsonwebtoken` for token-based authentication.
3. Add middleware for protected routes to verify JWTs.

---

#### **Milestone 4: CRUD API Development**
1. **Item Routes**:
   - `GET /api/items`: Get all items.
   - `GET /api/items/:id`: Get a specific item.
   - `POST /api/items`: Create a new item.
   - `PUT /api/items/:id`: Update an item.
   - `DELETE /api/items/:id`: Delete an item.

2. **Review Routes**:
   - `GET /api/items/:id/reviews`: Get all reviews for a specific item.
   - `POST /api/items/:id/reviews`: Add a review for an item.
   - `PUT /api/reviews/:id`: Update a review.
   - `DELETE /api/reviews/:id`: Delete a review.

3. **Comment Routes**:
   - `POST /api/reviews/:id/comments`: Add a comment to a review.
   - `PUT /api/comments/:id`: Update a comment.
   - `DELETE /api/comments/:id`: Delete a comment.

---

#### **Milestone 5: Testing**
1. Set up `jest` and `supertest` for testing API endpoints.
2. Write tests for:
   - User authentication.
   - CRUD operations for items, reviews, and comments.
3. Mock Prisma client for isolated unit tests.

---

#### **Milestone 6: Documentation**
1. Document all API endpoints in the `README.md` file.
   - Include request examples, response examples, and status codes.
2. Add comments to the code for maintainability.
3. Create an ER diagram for database relationships.

---

#### **Milestone 7: Deployment**
1. Configure the project for deployment (e.g., Docker or a cloud platform like Heroku or Render).
2. Push the repository to GitHub.
3. Deploy the application and provide the live API URL.
